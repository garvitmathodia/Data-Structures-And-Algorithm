Sorting algorithms can be categorized based on their time and space complexities in the best, average, and worst cases. Here's a summary of the time and space complexities of some common sorting algorithms:

>>>>>>>Bubble Sort:

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n) - when the array is already sorted.
Average Case Time Complexity: O(n^2).
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2) - when the array is sorted in reverse order.
Space Complexity: O(1) - uses a constant amount of additional space.

>>>>>Selection Sort:

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n^2).
Average Case Time Complexity: O(n^2).
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2).
Space Complexity: O(1).

>>>>>>Insertion Sort:

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n) - when the array is already sorted.
Average Case Time Complexity: O(n^2).
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2) - when the array is sorted in reverse order.
Space Complexity: O(1).

>>>>>Merge Sort:

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n log n).
Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log n).
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n log n).
Space Complexity: O(n) - additional space for the merge process.

>>>>>Quick Sort:

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n log n) - when the pivot selection results in balanced partitions.
Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log n).
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2) - when the pivot selection is unbalanced (e.g., always picking the smallest or largest element).
Space Complexity: O(log n) - for the recursion stack in the average and best cases. In the worst case, it can be O(n).

>>>>Heap Sort:

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n log n).
Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log n).
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n log n).
Space Complexity: O(1).

>>>>>>Counting Sort:

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n + k), where 'k' is the range of input values.
Average Case Time Complexity: O(n + k).
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n + k).
Space Complexity: O(n + k).

>>>>>Radix Sort:

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n * k), where 'k' is the number of digits in the maximum number.
Average Case Time Complexity: O(n * k).
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n * k).
Space Complexity: O(n + k).
